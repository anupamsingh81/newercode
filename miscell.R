# miscellaneous experiment
# if mistakes in pushing an already existing r directory to git
# first edit R project file so that it is version control by git instead of none,if no r project file create one in directory.
# create repository on github
# 
# Now we can go in shell of r studio and type following in order
# 1. git init
# 2. git add .
# 3. git commit -m 'message'
# 4. git remote add origin https://github.com/anupamsingh81/newercode.git replace newer code by name of repository
# 5. git push -u origin master

# miscell many times step 4 and 5 would be sufficient
